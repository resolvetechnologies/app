- **Next.js**: Next.js, a powerful React framework, served as the foundation for our web-based application, providing us with a robust and efficient platform for creating dynamic user interfaces and seamless client-side rendering.
- **Solidity**: In the realm of blockchain and decentralized applications, we harnessed the capabilities of Solidity, a specialized programming language. With Solidity, we developed smart contracts that power various aspects of our project, ensuring trust, transparency, and secure interactions on blockchain networks.
